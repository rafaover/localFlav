# localFlav
## 10 days eating as a local
An APP to show you how to contact the local food culture.

1. Choose a Location
2. Receive a list of local foods with their description and image
3. Check if you had the flavour
4. Explore other flavours

* This is a personal project but for general use. The idea came from the need to understand better how locals eat. I always want to avoid the tourist track and food is a great community builder.
