## 10 days eating as a local
An APP to show you how to contact the local food culture.

1. Choose a Location
2. Receive a list of local foods
3. Enjoy.

* This is a personal project but for general use. The idea came from the need to understand better how locals eat. I always want to avoid the tourist track and food is a great community builder.

## Design Plan:

The system design will be MVVM architecture, with a repository pattern. 

## Tools:
- 100% Kotlin
- Ui in Jetpack Compose
- Ktor (HTTP Client)
- Room (SQLite)
- Coil (Image Loading)
- Gemini/OpenAi API
- Material Design 3
